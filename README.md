# OpenZonePlayer

## Idea

There are several Sonos-compatible software-based controllers, but apparently there is no software-based ZonePlayer compatible player so far. Can we cange that? (Or is https://github.com/henkelis/sonospy one? "Music served from Sonos can now be rendered locally via BRisa renderer")

This is what would need to be done:
 1. Make the device discoverable with UPNP
 2. Respond to UPNP messages
